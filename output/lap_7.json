Utilize early upshifts and minimal steering angle to maintain traction and prevent excessive surface abrasion. A negative track temperature delta necessitates further input moderation, while a positive delta permits cautious exploration of grip thresholds. In case of further precipitation or accelerated degradation, box immediately for a wet compound. Anticipate Safety Car deployment or race suspension if conditions deteriorate.",
