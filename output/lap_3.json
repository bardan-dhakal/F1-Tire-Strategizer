On the in-lap, braking points must be advanced significantly to account for reduced surface adhesion and throttle application must be progressive to mitigate rear axle breakaway. A transition to the full wet compound is required if precipitation intensifies, and a track temperature drop will necessitate more aggressive inputs to maintain tire operating window. Accelerated degradation on the intermediate compound will advance the planned pit stop window.",
