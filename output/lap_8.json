In the event of a 10\u00b0C track temperature increase, extend lift-and-coast; for a 10\u00b0C decrease, be aggressive to build core temperature and prevent graining. For weather deterioration, report surface water levels and prepare for a switch to intermediate compounds. If degradation exceeds the predicted curve, initiate tire-saving protocols such as short-shifting and be prepared to bring the pit window forward.",
