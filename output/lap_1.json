Extend braking zones to manage low adhesion and apply smooth, progressive throttle to prevent rear axle instability. A 10\u00b0C track temperature decrease will lengthen the tire warm-up phase, while further weather deterioration will necessitate a transition to the full wet compound. Accelerated degradation on intermediates signals the crossover point for a return to a dry compound.",
