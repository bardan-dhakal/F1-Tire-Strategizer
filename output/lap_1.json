Utilize higher gears on corner exit for progressive throttle application to mitigate wheelspin. A wider line is required to search for mechanical grip; avoid all painted surfaces and standing water.\n\nShould precipitation increase, box immediately for the full wet compound. A 10\u00b0C drop in track temperature will make the hard compound unworkable, mandating a change to intermediate or wet tires. Accelerated degradation is a secondary factor to the critical lack of grip; the immediate response to any further negative condition is a pit stop for a treaded tire.",
