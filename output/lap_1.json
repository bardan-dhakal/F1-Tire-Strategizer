A +10\u00b0C track temperature delta requires managing surface temperatures via reduced slip angles, while a -10\u00b0C delta necessitates aggressive inputs to maintain core temperature. In the event of accelerated degradation, initiate tire-saving protocols including short-shifting and prepare for a revised pit window. Any precipitation requires an immediate pit stop for the appropriate wet compound and a rearward brake balance migration.",
