Extend braking zones by 50-70 meters to mitigate thermal saturation and prevent front-axle lock-ups. Employ progressive throttle application and minimize slip angles to reduce surface friction, preserving the tire carcass for an immediate pit stop. The primary objective is to box for a slick compound this lap.\n\n**Contingency Actions**\nA positive 10\u00b0C track temperature deviation will cause catastrophic blistering; abort the lap and box. Should precipitation commence, increase aggression to build core temperature into the operational range. Accelerated degradation is the expected baseline; manage thermal spikes with short-shifting and confirm pit lane entry for the appropriate dry compound.",
