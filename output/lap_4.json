Throttle application must be extremely progressive, utilizing short-shifting to manage torque delivery and mitigate rear slip on corner exit. For a 10\u00b0C track temperature drop, increase energy input on straights; for weather deterioration, anticipate an imminent pit call for wet compounds and likely race control intervention. Accelerated degradation under these conditions is anomalous, indicating a potential setup or mechanical fault requiring an immediate box for inspection.",
