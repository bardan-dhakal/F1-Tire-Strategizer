Post-pit, braking points must be brought forward and throttle application modulated to manage rear traction. Should track temperature fall, increase aggression on inputs to maintain core tire temperature; if rain intensifies, monitor aquaplaning risk as the crossover threshold for the Full Wet tire will be approached. Accelerated degradation of the Intermediate will force a review of stint length and potential for an additional stop.",
