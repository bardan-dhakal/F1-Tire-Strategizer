Apply minimal throttle percentage in the highest feasible gear to mitigate wheelspin on corner exit. A wide, constant radius line is required to minimize steering input and avoid inducing slip angle.\n\nA track temperature delta of \u00b110\u00b0C is sub-critical as the compound is outside its thermal window; maintain current parameters. In the event of increased precipitation, box immediately for the extreme wet compound. Accelerated degradation is improbable, but monitor for cold tearing and report any surface aberrations.",
